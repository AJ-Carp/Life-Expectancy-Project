# Life Expectancy General Information
For this project I analyzed a dataset from kaggle that contains information on every country. I first cleaned and explored the data with SQL, answering more general questions and then dug deeper to find reasoning and more nuanced information. Finally, I made visualizations with Tableau: [General Info](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/anthony.carpinello/viz/LifeExpectancy_17327397021130/GeneralInfo)

As you can see the countries who improved their life span the most actually had lower BMI and higher counts of diseases. This could suggest that the decreases in life expectancy is due to crime and violence rather then health related issues. Also, it is important to note that I did not take population into consideration.
